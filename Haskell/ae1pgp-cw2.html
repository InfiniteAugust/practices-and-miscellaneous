    <h1>AE1PGP Coursework 2 - Matrix functions (Haskell)</h1>


    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>This is the second AE1PGP Coursework.  It is worth <b>10% of the module mark</b>
      for this module.  It requires you to use Functional Programming and the Haskell programming language to write functions that can be used to manipulate mathematical matrices.</p>
      
      The deadline for this exercise is <b>18:00 on Thursday 17th May 2017</b>.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Read the entire document before beginning the exercise.</strong></p>

    <p>If you have any questions about this exercise, please ask after a lecture, in a lab, or on the Q&A forum on Moodle.
  If any questions require this exercise to be clarified then this 
document will be updated and everyone will be notified via Moodle.
    </p>

    <h3>Version History</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Version 1.0 - 2018-05-03 - Original version.</li>
      <li><b>Version 1.1 - 2018-05-07</b> - Version number bumped due to confusion over Q7 typo.</li>
    </ul>
<h2>Submission</h2>

    <p>You must submit a single file containing a Haskell script with all your code for this exercise.  The file must be named after your student ID number (ie, <code>6512345.hs</code>)
      and must not require any other functions outside of the standard Prelude, must work on the version of <code>ghci</code> installed on <code>cslinux</code>, and must not use any ghci extensions to Haskell.
      The first line of each file should be a 
comment which contains your student ID number, username, and full name, 
of the form:<br>
      <code style="padding-left:5em;">-- 6512345 zy12345 Joe Blogs</code>
    </p>

    <p>I will copy your file into a new directory.  Your script must load and compile in <code>ghci</code> without warnings or errors when I use the command<br>
      <code style="padding-left:5em;">ghci 6512345.hs</code><br>
      This command will be run on our Linux server <code>cslinux</code>.
  If it does not compile, for any reason, then you will lose all the 
marks for testing (common reasons in the past have been submitting a 
file with the wrong filename, or developing your solution on your 
personal computer without having tested it on our Linux server).  If the
 file compiles but has warnings then you will lose some marks for not 
correcting the warnings.
    </p>

    <p>The Haskell script file should be uploaded to the Coursework
      2 Submission link on the AE1PGP Moodle page.  You may submit 
as many times as you wish before the deadline (the last submission 
before the deadline will be used).  After the deadline has passed, if 
you have already submitted your exercise then you will not be able to 
submit again.  If you have not already submitted then you will be 
allowed to submit <b>once</b>.
    </p>

    <p>Remember that you can only access the Linux server from the 
designated labs in SEB and SSB and that these labs are also heavily 
booked for teaching.  <b>Do not</b> wait until the last moment to submit
 as you may find you cannot get into any of the rooms to access your 
source code files.  Not being able to access the machine due to lack of 
planning is <b>not</b> an extenuating circumstance.</p>

    <p><b>Late submissions</b>: AE1PGP late submission policy is <b>different</b> from the standard university policy.  Late submissions will lose 5 percentage points <b>per hour</b>,
 rounded up to the next whole hour.  This is to better represent the 
large benefit a small amount of extra time can give at the end of a 
programming exercise.  No late submissions will be accepted more than 24
 hours after the exercise deadline.  If you have extenuating 
circumstances you should file them before the deadline.</p>

    <h2>Plagiarism</h2>
    <b>
    <p>You should complete this coursework on your own.  Anyone 
suspected of plagiarism will be investigated and punished in accordance 
with the university policy on plagiarism (see your student handbook and 
the University Quality Manual). This may include a mark of zero for this
 coursework.</p>

    <p>You should write the source code required for this assignment 
yourself. If you use code from other sources (books, web pages, etc), 
you should use comments to acknowledge this (and marks will be heavily 
adjusted down according to the amount of original work).</p>

    <p>You must not copy or share source code with other students.  You 
must not work together on your solution.  You can informally talk about 
higher-level ideas but not to a level of detail that would allow you all
 to create the same source code.
    </p>

    <p>It is your responsibility to keep your submission private.  Do not
      share personal computers, usb drives, or any other circumstances which could
      reasonably be assumed to risk another student gaining access to your
      files.
    </p>
    
    <p>Remember, it is quite easy for experienced lecturers to spot 
plagiarism in source code.  If you are having problems you should ask 
questions rather then plagiarize.  If you are not able to complete the 
exercise then you should still submit your incomplete program as that 
will still get you some of the marks for the parts you have done (but 
make sure your incomplete solution compiles and partially runs!).
      </p>
    </b>


    <h2>Marking</h2>

    <p>
      Each question will be marked out of 2 marks, giving a maximum possible mark of 20.  1 mark will be awarded for correctness, 1 mark will be awarded for programming style.  In particular, you should aim to make your definitions as simple, clear, and elegant as possible.
    </p>

    <p>
      If a function specifies that it should use another function and you do not do that, you will receive 0/2 for that question.<br>
      If a function does not have the type given in the coursework, you will receive 0/2 for that question.<br>
      If a function does not have the name given in the coursework, you will receive 0/2 for that question.<br>
      The same principle applies to other situations; do not change things from the coursework.
    </p>

    <p>Late Submissions: see submission section above.</p>




    
      <h2>Task</h2>

    <p>One way to represent a matrix in Haskell is to use nested lists.  In this coursework, we will use the following representation: a <i>r</i>-by-<i>c</i> matrix containing values of type <code>a</code> has <i>r</i> rows and <i>c</i> columns and is represented as a list of <i>r</i> lists of <i>c</i> values of type <i>a</i>.  Given as a Haskell type, this is:
      <pre>
	type Matrix a = [[a]]
      </pre>

      Some examples are:
      <pre>
	-- 4 x 2 matrix
	eg1 :: Matrix Int
	eg1 = [ [1, 3],
                [0, 5],
                [-3, 4],
                [2, 2] ]
	
	-- 2 x 3 matrix
	eg2 :: Matrix Int
	eg2 = [ [3, 1, 4],
                [-1, 0, 5] ]
	
	-- 0 x 0 matrix, an empty matrix
	eg3 :: Matrix Int
	eg3 = [ [] ]
	
	-- 2x1 matrix
	eg4 :: Matrix Int
	eg4 = [ [2],
                [3] ]
	
	eg5 :: Matrix Double
	eg5 = [ [6.2, 4.3, 7.4, -7.3],
                [9.3, 1.2, 0.4, -6.2] ]
      </pre>

      
      Note that in our definition, the empty matrix with no values is a valid matrix represented as <code>[[]]</code>, a list containing one empty list (which is not the same as <code>[]</code> which is just an empty list).
      You can assume that all <code>Matrix</code> inputs are correctly formed (each nested list is the same length, ensuring a square or rectangular matrix).
    </p>

    <p>The aim of this coursework is to write a Haskell script to manipulate matrices using this representation.
      Lines starting with > are lines typed into the the ghci REPL. They are not lines which should appear in your Haskell script.
    </p>
    <p>
      You should copy both the <code>Matrix</code> definition and the example matrices above into your script file.  Do not change their definitions.  Implement the functions below on your own.  Do not <code>import</code> any other Haskell modules - you can only use the Prelude functions and functions you write yourself.  You may write any helper functions you need and you may use the answers to any of the questions below in subsequent answers.  You may wish to consult the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_%28mathematics%29">Wikipedia page on Matrices</a> if you wish to refresh your knowledge of basic matrix operations.
    </p>

    <h3>Functions</h3>
    
    <ol>
      <li>Define a function
	<pre>
	  empty :: Matrix a -> Bool
	</pre>
	that returns <code>True</code> if the matrix is empty and <code>False</code> otherwise.

	For example:
	<pre>
	  > empty eg1
	  False
	  > empty eg2
	  False
	  > empty eg3
	  True
	</pre>
	<hr />
      </li>

      
      <li>Define a function
	<pre>
	  rowCount :: Matrix a -> Int
	</pre>
	that returns the number of rows in the matrix.  Hint: this is easy, except in the case of an empty matrix (the empty matrix will be a special case of many functions in this coursework so remember to consider that situation).

	For example:
	<pre>
	  > rowCount eg1
	  4
	  > rowCount eg2
	  2
	  > rowCount eg3
	  0
	</pre>
	<hr />
      </li>


      <li>Define a function
	<pre>
	  columnCount :: Matrix a -> Int
	</pre>
	that returns the number of columns in the matrix.

	For example:
	<pre>
	  > columnCount eg1
	  2
	  > columnCount eg2
	  3
	  > columnCount eg3
	  0
	</pre>
	<hr />
      </li>


      <li>Define a function
	<pre>
	  element' :: Matrix a -> Int -> Int -> a
	</pre>
	that returns the value in the matrix at the given row and column position.  For this function you should assume that the row and column position will always be valid for the given matrix.

	For example:
	<pre>
	  > element' eg1 0 1
	  3
	  > element' eg1 2 0
	  -3
	  > element' eg2 1 1
	  0
	</pre>
	<hr />
      </li>


      <li>Define a function
	<pre>
	  element :: Matrix a -> Int -> Int -> Maybe a
	</pre>
	that returns the value in the matrix at the given row and column position, or <code>Nothing</code> if that is not a valid position for the given matrix.

	<pre>
	  > element eg1 0 0
	  Just 1
	  > element eg1 0 1
	  Just 3
	  > element eg1 0 2
	  Nothing
	</pre>
	<hr />
      </li>


      <li>The type
	<pre>data Either a b = Left a | Right b</pre>
	type can be used to represent values of either one of two potential types.  It is often used in Haskell to represent the possibility of an error or an actual answer.  This is similar to the <code>Maybe</code> type, but in the "error" case, <code>Maybe</code> can only say <code>Nothing</code> with no extra information about the reason why.  Haskell convention is that the <code>Left</code> constructor is used to communicate information about the error and the <code>Right</code> constructor is used to give the actual answer (the way to remember is that "Right" is a synonym for "correct").  The <code>Either</code> type is part of the Standard Prelude.

	<p>Given the type:
	  <pre>data MatrixErr = NegIndex     -- represents an index being negative
               | RowTooLarge  -- represents a row index being too large for the matrix
               | ColTooLarge  -- represents a column index being too large for the matrix
               deriving Show
	</pre>
	define the function
	<pre>
	  elementEth :: Matrix a -> Int -> Int -> Either MatrixErr a
	</pre>
	that returns the value in the matrix at the given row and column position, or a <code>Left</code> value with the appropriate error value from <code>MatrixErr</code>.  Note:  you will need to copy the definition of <code>MatrixErr</code> into your script.  If multiple error conditions are true, you can return any of the appropriate errors.
	
	<pre>
	  > elementEth eg1 0 1
	  Right 3
	  > elementEth eg1 0 0
	  Right 1
	  > elementEth eg1 0 5
	  Left ColTooLarge
	  > elementEth eg1 5 0
	  Left RowTooLarge
	  > elementEth eg1 0 (-1)
	  Left NegIndex
	</pre>
	<hr />
      </li>

      <li>Define a function
	<pre>
	  identity :: Int -> Maybe (Matrix Int)
	</pre>
	that returns the Identity matrix for the given size.  An Identity matrix is a square matrix which has zero for all values, except the values on the top-left to bottom-right diagonal which are all one.  If the size is less than 1, then the identity matrix isn't defined and <code>Nothing</code> should be returned.

	For example:
	<pre>
	  > identity 2
	  Just [[1,0],[0,1]]
	  > identity 5
	  Just [[1,0,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0,0],[0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,1,0],[0,0,0,0,1]]
	  > identity 0
	  Nothing
	  > identity (-1)
	  Nothing
	</pre>
	<hr />
      </li>



      <li>Define a function
	<pre>
	  addMat :: Num a => Matrix a -> Matrix a -> Maybe (Matrix a)
	</pre>
	which takes two matrices and adds them together.  Matrices may only be added together if they have the same number of rows and columns.  If they do not, return <code>Nothing</code>.  If they do, the values in the result matrix are the addition of the two values at the same positions in the two argument matrices.

	For example:
	<pre>
	  > addMat eg1 eg1
	  Just [[2,6],[0,10],[-6,8],[4,4]]
	  > addMat eg1 eg2
	  Nothing
	  > addMat eg3 eg3
	  Nothing
	</pre>
	<hr />
      </li>

      <li>Define a higher-order function
	<pre>
	  mapMat :: (a -> b) -> Matrix a -> Matrix b
	</pre>
	that takes a function and a matrix and returns the matrix with the function applied to each value in the matrix.  This should be the Matrix equivalent of <code>map</code> over a list.

	For example:
	<pre>
	  > mapMat (+1) eg5
	  [[7.2,5.3,8.4,-6.3],[10.3,2.2,1.4,-5.2]]
	  > mapMat odd eg2
	  [[True,True,False],[True,False,True]]
	  > mapMat (+1) eg3
	  [[]]
	</pre>
	<hr />
      </li>


      
      <li>Define a function
	<pre>
	  compress :: Num a => Matrix a -> Matrix a
	</pre>
	that takes an <i>r</i>-by-<i>c</i> Matrix and returns a new <i>r</i>-by-1 Matrix where the values in each row have been replaced by a length 1 list containing the total value from adding together all the values in that row.

	For example:
	<pre>
	  >  compress eg1
	  [[4],[5],[1],[4]]
	  >  compress eg5
	  [[10.599999999999998],[4.7]]
	  > compress eg3
	  [[]]
	</pre>
	<hr />
      </li>


	
    </ol>
